3 color - full color LED module<br>
<br>
Overview:<br>
The RGB LED module is made of a plug-in full-color LED that can be adjusted by the PWM voltage inputs of the R, G, and B pins.<br>
The intensity of the three primary colors (red/blue/green) is achieved to achieve a full-color color mixing effect. Control of the module with Arduino<br>
Cool lighting effects.<br>
<br>
Product Features:<br>
1, use plug-in full color LED<br>
2, RGB three primary color connected to the current limiting resistor to prevent burnout<br>
3, through the PWM adjustment three primary colors can be mixed to get different colors<br>
4, can interface with various microcontrollers<br>
5, working voltage: 5V<br>
6, LED drive mode: common negative drive
