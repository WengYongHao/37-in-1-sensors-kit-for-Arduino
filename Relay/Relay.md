#Main Purpose
The relay is an automatic switching element with isolation function, which is widely used in remote control, telemetry, communication, automatic control,<br>
Among the mechatronics and power electronics, it is one of the most important control components.<br>
It comes down to the following effects:<br>
1) Expand the control range: For example, when the multi-contact relay control signal reaches a certain value, it can press the contact group<br>
In the same form, switch, disconnect, and turn on multiple circuits at the same time.<br>
2) Amplification: For example, sensitive relays, intermediate relays, etc., can be controlled with a very small amount of control.<br>
Power circuit.<br>
3) Integrated signal: For example, when multiple control signals are input into a multi-winding relay in a prescribed form,<br>
In order to achieve the predetermined control effect.<br>
4) Automatic, remote control, monitoring: For example, the relay on the automatic device can be programmed together with other electrical appliances.<br>
